# buffer-pool
A buffer pool using LRU eviction policy.

## Work in Progress
Buffer-Pool is a work in progress. The purpose of the project is to extract what I've 
learned from the [Code Crafters SQLite challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/sqlite/overview) 
into a working buffer pool with some chance of working with a transaction manager and b+trees. 

Why am I reinventing the storage engine? Because I want to know how they work.
